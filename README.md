## TODO:
* [ ] Change collision mask on `Door` so that it only collides with `Player`
* [ ] Add scene change
  * Doors each have a value that corrospond with their exit on the specified level. Say door 3 in Level_1 leads to door 3 in Level_2. This helps us know where to place the player in the game world being loaded. 
  * [ ] Add scene change transition
* [ ]  Add a jump effect
* [ ]  Add a grapple effect
* [ ]  Add player sound effects
* [ ]  Change up the world to something more like Fez
* [ ]  Add slow camera tracking
* [ ]  Add impactful camera zoom transitions
* [ ]  Add an NPC
* [ ]  Make the NPC move around slowly occasionally
* [ ]  Create a dialog system (oh boy, here we go...)
* [ ]  Make the NPC talk-to-able while they're idle
  * Add a little speech bubble pop-up overhead when they can be talked to
  * If the NPC has any unspoken dialog, make the icon yellow, else gray
* [ ] Add a sound effect for the dialog while each character is being added to the dialog box

* Make the game arcade-ish
* have enemeys burst through the background, like giant worms
* have enemies like the flytrap in HoD
